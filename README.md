Two Planes: A Chill Unity2D Game for Mobile Platform (Android)

About the Game:

Hey there! So, I've whipped up this little game called "Two Planes." It's all about two planes – yeah, you guessed it – and you get to steer them through this colorful, kinda tricky world full of stuff to dodge and cool things to grab. I built this whole thing using Unity2D and worked some coding magic with C#. It's been my way of leveling up my Unity2D skills, and I'm pretty stoked to share it with you.


What's Inside:

Double Trouble Flying: You're the master of two planes at once. It's like patting your head and rubbing your tummy – but with planes.

Game On, Reflexes: So, you gotta dodge obstacles to score points. It's like an obstacle course in the sky.

Eye Candy Graphics: I made sure the game looks smooth and sleek, with those classic 2D vibes. Trust me, your eyes will thank you.

Keep It Rollin': The game keeps going forever. Endless fun, my friend.

Phone-Friendly: Oh, and I've made sure it's a blast to play on your phone. Perfect for those moments when you're waiting for a friend or chilling on a lazy Sunday.


How to Pilot:

Tap the left side to steer the right plane.

Tap the right side to steer the right plane.

Slip your planes through the gaps between obstacles.


Behind the Scenes:
I cooked this whole thing up as a personal challenge. I wanted to get better at Unity2D, and did it teach me a lot! Inside the project's code, you'll see how I put together the game mechanics, made things look nice, and set up those touch controls.


Join the Fun:
I'm all ears for any ideas, suggestions, or fixes you might have. Whether you're a coding guru or just starting, your input could make "Two Planes" even more awesome.


No Legal Mumbo Jumbo:
You're free to tinker with the code, use it, and even share it.


Big Shoutout:
Massive thanks to the Unity community and the tons of online tutorials that guided me through this adventure.
